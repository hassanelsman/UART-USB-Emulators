# UART-USB-Emulators
- Specefication.pdf is the file which specify the whole specifications and required output format given a specific configurations.
- there are 2 MATLAB codes for UART & USB that emulate the protocols in the transmiting mode and calculate the latancy, delay, and other parametars.
- UART - USB Final.m is a code that read the input.jons configuration file and choose the desired protocol with these configurations.
- output.jons is and pretty file that text the outpot results.
- Documntation_Report.pdf is a pdf file that explain the codes and compare between the 2 protocols in many configurations and show the best protocol in each case.
